# diamonds

This project aims to predict the prices of diamonds based on factors like depth, weight etc using Machine Learning Models. For this project, I have used the diamonds dataset from Kaggle.com which lists different indices like diamonds weight,depth etc. In this project, I have used the Random Forest algorithm and by using this algorithm, the model is able to predict the prices of diamonds based on the indices in the dataset with approximately 98 percent accuracy.
